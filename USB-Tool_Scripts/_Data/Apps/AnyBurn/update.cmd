title Updating AnyBurn

rem Updates this app with the shared helper _Data\Apps\_Update-App.ps1 (see that file for the options)
rem Run it on its own, or let Update-Tool.cmd run it for every app
rem Each kind of download has its own folder here: Installer (install.cmd), Portable (run.cmd), CLI (cli.cmd)

rem clear PSModulePath so Windows PowerShell loads its own modules (it breaks if started from PowerShell 7)
set "PSModulePath="
set "result=0"
set "resultRank=0"
