# Guide: App Specific Passwords (Telstra)

If the normal account password is not working in a mail client _(i.e. Outlook, Apple Mail, etc..)_ then an App Specific Password may be required.</br>
This is often required when an account has increased security or two factor authentication enabled.

A new App Specific Password should be generated for each individual use-case/application, and should not be re-used.</br>
And if you need to re-log in to an application or service that already uses an App Specific Password, you should delete/revoke the old password first and then generate a new one to use.
